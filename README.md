ATLAS

Description
===========
ATLAS is a top-down 2D survival adventure game that focuses on exploring unique maps and action combat. The player starts at a random location where 
they must survive a given amount of time against waves of enemies until a teleporter arrives, which when used, progresses the player to the next level.
Each map will have multiple chests randomly spawned throughout, containing new weapons, items or upgrades for the player when opened. As the games level
increases, so does its difficulty, the player will need to survive for longer and versus tougher enemies. The players skill with ATLAS' action-
combat system will be a defining factor on how well they do!
